/*
All code files to be submitted as part of the submission should have a name block at the top.
The name block should clearly indicate
the Lab Number,
the name of the person, and
a one line statement explaining the purpose of the assignment.
Your code files should also include
pre/post headers as discussed in the documentation guidelines in the first week of class, and
have a comment block of pseudocode as necessary just before the relevant section of the code.
Remember - pseudocode is not the same as inline comments or comments all over the code.
Remember to include a 'pause' of some type before your program exits to allow me to observe the console output when I compile and run your program.
 

Things to remember:

Only submissions in ZIP file format will be accepted - no gzip, 7z, tar, rar or any other file format.
Not including the name block will result in a 10% penalty.
Not including screenshots will result in a 10% penalty.
Not including pseudocode where necessary will result in a 20% penalty.
Not including pre/post headers will result in a 20% penalty.
